            <h4>Aircraft Maintenance Engineer - Technician</h4>
            <p>
              Gained hands-on training in aircraft maintenance across general, business, and transport aviation. 
              Worked on fixed and rotary wing aircraft in modern labs and hangars, focusing on airframes, engines, 
              electrical, hydraulic, and avionics systems. Learned both practical techniques and essential theory, 
              including the foundations required toward an Aircraft Maintenance Engineer (AME – “M” rating), 
              preparing to certify aircraft for flight after maintenance or repair.
