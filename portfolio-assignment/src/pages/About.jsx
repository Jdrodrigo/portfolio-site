            I’m Jan Daniel Baldovino, a Software Engineering Technology – Artificial 
            Intelligence student at Centennial College. My academic journey has given me 
            hands-on experience with programming languages such as Java, Python, C#, and SQL, 
            as well as front-end technologies like React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
          </p>

            I enjoy building practical, user-friendly applications and exploring how AI design 
            patterns can be applied to solve real-world problems. Beyond coding, I’m motivated 
            by continuous learning and a passion for technology that drives me to stay updated 
            with the latest trends in software engineering and intelligent systems.
